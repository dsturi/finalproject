# finalproject
This is my final project for the ocg 404 course 
I collected data from kaggle to study breast cancer histology to see which are bening and malignant 
Also i will be making analysis, visualizations and some statistics to help you understand the data
## Visualize data
after the data is loaded into my note book I used pandas to read the dataframe and visual inspect and begin analyzing and manipulating data
I also installed keras and other machine learning libraries that i will be showing in my program. 
I also trained the seperated the data into training and testing to choose the model that is most accurate.
